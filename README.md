- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick Taylor
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying at Colorado School of Mines as an MS student in the Mechanical Engineering department and getting a graduate certificate in Space Resources. I'm on track to complete graduate degree coursework tracks in both Robotics/Controls & Structures/Solid Mechanics by the end of my degree, and I'm part of the Autonomy, Robotics and Intelligent Algorithms (ARIA) research lab on campus as a hardware lead. 
- âš¡ I studied Aerospace Engineering at University of Colorado Boulder for my undergraduate degree. I graduated in 2022 with minors in Mathematics and Space Sciences.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m always interested in learning new skills. I find the following coursework and professional topics the most enjoyable and intriguing: dynamics, kinematics, controls, FEA, manufacturing and machining, modeling and simulation, testing, and others!
