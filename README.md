- 👋 Hi, I’m @taylorxnick
- 👀 I’m most interested in learning new skills! I find the following coursework and professional topics the most enjoyable and itnriguing:
      - dynamics, kinematics, controls, FEA, manufacturing and machining, modeling and simulation, testing, and others!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying at Colorado School of Mines as an MS student in the Mechanical Engineering department
      - Current Course List (as of Spring 2024): Partial Differential Equations, FEA, Mechatronics and Robot Kinematics/Dynamics, Neural Network Robot Controls, Space Resources and Special Topics in Advanced Dynamics
- 📫 Email me at taylornixck@gmail.com (I don't check that email very often though)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite recreational reading genre is anything UFO's (nonfiction)
